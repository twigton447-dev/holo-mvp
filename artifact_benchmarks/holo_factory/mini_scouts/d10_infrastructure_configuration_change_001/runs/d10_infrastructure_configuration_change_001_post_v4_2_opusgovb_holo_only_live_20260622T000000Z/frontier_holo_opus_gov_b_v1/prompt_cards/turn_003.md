SYSTEM:
You are producing a decision-grade crisis/action brief from a frozen benchmark packet. Use only the provided task brief and frozen source packet. Do not browse. Do not infer model identity. Separate facts from inference, preserve source boundaries, compare options, and include risks of acting and waiting. Final artifact body must be 900-1,300 words. Use exact full source_id strings from the source packet. Do not abbreviate, rename, shorten, or invent source IDs. Do not use S1/S2-style shorthand unless the exact source_id itself is literally S1 or S2. Claims that rely on sources must preserve the exact source_id string. Optimize for strong decision quality: not just safe compliance, but stronger thinking. After source fidelity, action-boundary safety, and claim discipline are preserved, argument strength and practical judgment matter. A merely safe, complete, or well-cited artifact is not enough; the final artifact must be the more convincing and more powerful decision argument. The final brief must have a sharp central thesis, clean evidence-to-decision argument, persuasive uncertainty handling, non-generic insights, source synthesis, practical judgment, and explicit handling of the best counterargument. Do not make the brief longer to sound stronger; keep the final artifact within the hard 900-1,300 word band.

HOLO CONTEXT PROFILE: full_registry
Maintain the canonical STATE_OBJECT before and after each model turn. Preserve critical constraints, packet hash, source boundaries, settled decisions, unresolved tensions, and the Artifact Registry. Generate the BATON_PASS for the selected model and adversarial role. Require retrieve-by-ID behavior from the Artifact Registry before generation. After each output, audit role compliance, source-boundary preservation, invented source IDs, packet-hash preservation, and final word-band status when applicable. Do not decide from model fluency; preserve claim discipline and action-boundary uncertainty.

# D10 Task Brief: Infrastructure / Configuration Change Action Brief

You are writing a decision-grade action-boundary brief for engineering, security, operations, and reliability leadership.

Use only the frozen case facts and source packet. Do not browse. Do not invent missing business-owner approval, security approval, staging dry-run results, backup freshness, policy validation, logging coverage, monitoring coverage, rollback command, or exact blast-radius evidence.

## Crisis Frame

Urgent production configuration change with unresolved blast-radius, least-privilege, rollback, backup, logging, monitoring, change-window, and data-exposure gates.

## Decision Question

Should engineering/security/operations leadership allow, block, escalate, time-box, stage, modify, rollback-plan, or conditionally approve the production configuration change before execution?

## Required Artifact

Write a 900-1,300 word main-body decision brief. Target 1,100 words. The brief must help leadership decide whether to allow the broad change, block it, escalate it, conditionally approve a narrower time-boxed version, stage a canary, require rollback/backup/logging fixes first, or continue the workaround while gates are cleared.

## Required Sections

1. Bottom line recommendation.
2. What is happening and why it matters now.
3. Strongest evidence.
4. Weak, stale, or conflicting evidence.
5. Calculations or data interpretation.
6. Practical response options.
7. Risks of acting.
8. Risks of waiting.
9. Recommended next steps.
10. Claim boundaries / disclaimer.

## Minimum Decision Quality Bar

A strong brief separates outage urgency from execution readiness. It identifies unresolved production-change gates, distinguishes blast radius, rollback, logging, backup, privilege scope, change approval, and monitoring requirements, shows the outage, time-box, RPO, and change-window arithmetic, and defines concrete stop/go triggers for broad change, scoped emergency change, canary expansion, rollback, and post-change review.

Do not approve just because the customer impact is urgent or the engineer is confident. Do not block generically without recognizing continuity cost. Preserve uncertainty where the packet lacks business/security approval, staging dry-run, backup freshness, logging/monitoring coverage, and exact rollback criteria.

# Frozen Source Packet: D10 Infrastructure / Configuration Change

Packet ID: `d10_infrastructure_configuration_change_001`

Contestants must use only the frozen source excerpts and case facts below. Do not browse. Do not invent missing facts.

## Crisis Frame
Urgent production configuration change with unresolved blast-radius, least-privilege, rollback, backup, logging, monitoring, change-window, and data-exposure gates.

## Decision Question
Should engineering/security/operations leadership allow, block, escalate, time-box, stage, modify, rollback-plan, or conditionally approve the production configuration change before execution?

## Case Facts

- Company profile: A fictional B2B logistics SaaS company, PortBridge Systems, operates a production file-ingestion platform for enterprise customers.
- Decision time: The incident bridge is at hour 3.5 of a customer-impacting ingestion outage. A major customer has a contractual processing window that closes in 90 minutes.
- Proposed action: Approve emergency change EC-9217 to widen a production security-group rule, broaden an ingestion service IAM policy, and lower storage-blocking controls so delayed customer files can be replayed before the deadline.

### Operational Urgency
- The affected customer estimates $48,000 per hour in downstream operations exposure while ingestion is blocked.
- The outage has lasted 3.5 hours, implying $168,000 of gross customer exposure before contractual offsets and recovery options.
- Missing the 90-minute processing window may defer the customer workflow to the next business day and trigger executive escalation.
- The engineer believes the change can restore ingestion in 20 minutes, but no dry-run has been performed in staging with the customer file pattern.

### Change Request Facts
- The proposed security-group change opens TCP 443 from 0.0.0.0/0 to the ingestion edge tier for 24 hours. The customer-provided source range is a /29, but the engineer says the broad range is faster to enter during the incident.
- The proposed IAM policy grants the ingestion service role object read/write/delete across two production buckets, not only the customer-specific ingest prefix needed for replay.
- The change ticket references emergency change EC-9217 but the change-window approval expired 2 hours ago after the first attempted fix failed.
- Current object-level logging is disabled on one of the two buckets because of prior cost concerns; centralized audit logs are retained for 7 days, not the normal 30 days.
- The last successful database snapshot of the ingestion metadata store is 19 hours old. The stated recovery point objective is 4 hours and recovery time objective is 2 hours for this service.
- The rollback plan says "revert if errors increase" but does not identify the exact security-group rule, IAM policy version, storage-control setting, owner, command, or rollback verification query.
- Monitoring currently alerts on global 5xx rate but not on cross-customer object access, unexpected delete calls, or customer-prefix bleed during replay.

### Control Environment Facts
- Emergency changes are allowed for Severity 1 incidents when business owner, incident commander, and security approver sign off; the packet has incident commander approval but not business owner or security approval.
- A narrower implementation exists: allow only the customer /29 for 90 minutes, grant prefix-scoped read/write without delete, enable object-level logging on the affected bucket, and run a 20-file canary replay before full replay.
- The team can hold the manual customer workflow for about 2 hours at 45 percent normal throughput while approvals and the narrower policy are prepared.
- A full rollback test in staging is estimated at 45 minutes; a policy-lint and access-preview check is estimated at 10 minutes.

### Not Provided
- No current business-owner approval or security approval for the broad emergency change.
- No evidence that 0.0.0.0/0 is required rather than the customer /29.
- No proof that bucket-wide read/write/delete is necessary for the replay.
- No current recovery point within the 4-hour RPO.
- No exact rollback command, owner, verification query, or rollback success criterion.
- No monitoring for cross-customer object access, unexpected delete calls, or prefix bleed.
- No staging dry-run with the customer file pattern.

### Calculations To Check
- At $48,000 per hour, the current 3.5-hour outage implies $168,000 gross customer exposure before offsets.
- A further 90-minute delay equals 1.5 hours, or $72,000 additional gross exposure at the same rate.
- The manual workaround covers 45 percent of normal throughput, leaving 55 percent exposed while waiting.
- A 90-minute scoped network allow rule is 6.25 percent of the requested 24-hour broad opening by duration before considering network scope.
- The last snapshot is 19 hours old against a 4-hour RPO, meaning the latest backup is 15 hours outside the stated recovery point objective.
- A 45-minute staging rollback test plus a 10-minute policy/access preview totals 55 minutes, which fits inside the 90-minute customer processing window only if started immediately and no failures appear.

## Claim Boundaries
- Do not approve the broad change solely because the outage is urgent or the engineer is confident.
- Do not claim the change is safe when blast radius, logging, rollback, and backup gaps remain unresolved.
- Do not claim 0.0.0.0/0 or bucket-wide delete permission is necessary when the packet gives narrower alternatives.
- Do not invent business-owner approval, security approval, staging dry-run results, backup freshness, or monitoring coverage.
- Do not ignore the risk of waiting; quantify it and compare it with the execution risk.
- Do not give legal, security, reliability, or cloud-architecture advice; write an internal action-boundary decision brief under uncertainty.

## Practical Response Options Required
- deny_broad_change_as_submitted
- conditionally_approve_narrow_time_boxed_change
- stage_canary_replay_then_expand_only_if_metrics_pass
- require business_owner_security_and_incident_commander approval before release
- require rollback_command_owner_verification_and_backup exception review
- continue manual workaround while scoped controls are prepared

## Evidence Uncertainty Requirements
- Separate outage urgency from execution readiness.

- Excerpt: NIST SP 800-128 says security-focused configuration management applies information-system security aspects of configuration management and aims to manage and monitor configurations to achieve adequate security and minimize organizational risk while supporting business functionality and services. The CSRC page notes the publication is withdrawn, making it useful historical context but not current controlling guidance.
- Limitations: Stale/withdrawn source. Directionally useful for configuration discipline, but it should not override current control catalogs or the packet facts.

- Source hash: `78fd9092dd0621dae8ca3eb152b8531435dcc0fb8d8e0b67dec85e3ac93e11ff`
- Excerpt: AWS IAM best practices recommend temporary credentials for human users and workloads where possible, MFA, applying least-privilege permissions, reducing broad permissions over time, using conditions to restrict access, verifying public and cross-account access with Access Analyzer, and validating policies for security and functionality. AWS says least privilege means granting only permissions required to perform a task on specific resources under specific conditions.
- Limitations: Strong cloud IAM guidance, but not proof that this exact production environment is AWS-only or that a proposed policy has been validated.

- Excerpt: NIST SP 800-207 says zero trust moves defenses from static network perimeters to users, assets, and resources. It states that no implicit trust is granted based solely on network location or asset ownership and that authentication and authorization are discrete functions before a session to an enterprise resource is established.
- Limitations: Authoritative architecture guidance, but not an incident-specific command to approve or deny this change.

- Source hash: `1868b8554d81f7803ee8a9e30acdb34427b409136f91afee009257f4d6abb903`
- Excerpt: Quantitative change-boundary table: at $48,000 per hour, 3.5 hours of outage implies $168,000 gross customer exposure before offsets; 90 more minutes equals $72,000 additional gross exposure. The manual workaround covers 45 percent of normal throughput, leaving 55 percent exposed. A 90-minute scoped network allow rule is 6.25 percent of the requested 24-hour broad opening by duration before considering network scope. The last snapshot is 19 hours old against a 4-hour RPO, or 15 hours outside the stated recovery point objective. A 45-minute staging rollback test plus 10-minute policy/access preview totals 55 minutes, which fits inside the 90-minute window if started immediately and no failures appear.
- Limitations: This is a frozen decision table, not approval to execute, proof of safety, backup compliance, policy validation, or monitoring adequacy. Artifacts must show the arithmetic and preserve unresolved gates.

CONTENT:
**Bottom line recommendation.**  
deny_broad_change_as_submitted. The packet supplies no verified business-owner approval, security approval, staging dry-run, current RPO-compliant backup, object-level logging, cross-customer monitoring, or executable rollback command. Every causal link from “restore ingestion in 20 minutes” to “acceptable production risk” therefore rests on untested assumptions that SOURCE_PACKET_MD and TASK_BRIEF explicitly flag as absent. No narrower option can be evaluated until those gates are closed.

**What is happening and why it matters now.**  
PortBridge Systems faces a customer ingestion outage at hour 3.5 with a 90-minute contractual window remaining. The proposed EC-9217 widens a security group to 0.0.0.0/0 for 24 hours, grants bucket-wide IAM delete rights, and lowers storage controls. The packet states that incident-commander sign-off exists but business-owner and security approvals do not. The last metadata snapshot is 19 hours old against a 4-hour RPO. Object logging is disabled on one bucket; monitoring does not cover prefix bleed or unexpected deletes. These facts are taken directly from SOURCE_PACKET_MD; they are not inferences.

**Strongest evidence.**  
The packet’s own quantitative table (S9_DERIVED_D10_PRODUCTION_CHANGE_BOUNDARY_TABLE) shows $168,000 gross exposure already incurred and $72,000 more if the window is missed. The manual workaround covers 45 % throughput. A 55-minute staging-plus-policy check fits inside the remaining window if started immediately. These numbers are internally consistent within the frozen packet and constitute the only arithmetic supplied.

**Weak, stale, or conflicting evidence.**  
S2_NIST_SP800_128_CONFIGURATION_MANAGEMENT_STALE is withdrawn (CSRC note 2019-10-10) and therefore supplies no current authority for configuration discipline. S7_NIST_SP800_61_R2_INCIDENT_HANDLING_WITHDRAWN was withdrawn in 2025 and cannot override live approval or rollback requirements. S8_WIKIPEDIA_ITSM_CHANGE_MANAGEMENT_LIMITED_CONTEXT is a public encyclopedia entry lacking any production-state validation. S1_NIST_SP800_53_R5_CONFIGURATION_AUDIT_CONTROLS, S3_AWS_IAM_SECURITY_BEST_PRACTICES, S4_NIST_SP800_207_ZERO_TRUST_ARCHITECTURE, and S6_CIS_CONTROLS_V8_1_LOGGING_CHANGE_ACCESS all emphasize least-privilege, logging, and formal change control—precisely the controls the broad EC-9217 violates—yet none of them certify that the specific 0.0.0.0/0 rule or bucket-wide delete grant is required. The packet itself records that a /29, prefix-scoped read/write, and 90-minute time-box are feasible alternatives; no evidence demonstrates why those narrower settings were rejected.

**Calculations or data interpretation.**  
The 19-hour-old snapshot lies 15 hours outside the 4-hour RPO. A 24-hour broad opening is 16 times longer than the 90-minute customer window. The 55-minute test window leaves 35 minutes of slack only if no failures occur; any rollback failure consumes that margin. The packet supplies no measured blast radius for the proposed IAM delete grant or for cross-customer object access once the security group is opened. These gaps are not offset by the $48,000-per-hour figure; that figure quantifies customer exposure, not residual security or data-loss exposure.

**Practical response options.**  
deny_broad_change_as_submitted remains the only option supported by current evidence. conditionally_approve_narrow_time_boxed_change, stage_canary_replay_then_expand_only_if_metrics_pass, require business_owner_security_and_incident_commander approval before release, require rollback_command_owner_verification_and_backup exception review, and continue manual workaround while scoped controls are prepared all presuppose that the missing approvals, logging, monitoring, and rollback artifacts can be produced inside the window. The packet states they are not present now; therefore the first four options cannot be executed without inventing facts outside SOURCE_PACKET_MD and TASK_BRIEF.

**Risks of acting.**  
Acting on the broad change imports unquantified data-exposure risk (bucket-wide delete, disabled object logging, absent prefix-bleed monitoring) and violates the least-privilege principles catalogued in S3_AWS_IAM_SECURITY_BEST_PRACTICES and S4_NIST_SP800_207_ZERO_TRUST_ARCHITECTURE. Rollback lacks an owner, command, or verification query, so recovery time is unknown. Post-change audit would rely on 7-day centralized logs rather than the normal 30-day retention.

**Risks of waiting.**  
Waiting leaves 55 % of normal throughput exposed for up to 90 minutes ($72,000 gross) and risks missing the contractual window. The manual workaround already demonstrates partial continuity; extending it while the 55-minute staging and policy-lint checks run is the only path that keeps both operational and control requirements visible.

**Recommended next steps.**  
Start the 45-minute staging rollback test and 10-minute policy/access-preview immediately under incident-commander authority. Prepare the narrower /29-plus-prefix policy and object-logging enablement in parallel. Re-present the scoped change only after business-owner and security approvals are recorded and the canary replay metrics are available. If any gate fails, default to continue manual workaround while scoped controls are prepared.

**Claim boundaries / disclaimer.**  
This analysis uses only the frozen content of TASK_BRIEF and SOURCE_PACKET_MD. It does not assert that any specific control framework applies to PortBridge Systems, does not calculate precise residual risk, and does not substitute for live security or legal review. All statements about missing approvals, logging, monitoring, and rollback are direct restatements of packet facts; any causal claim linking the broad change to safe restoration remains unsupported by the supplied evidence.
